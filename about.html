I am a student at the University of Kansas.</p><p>I've previously graduated with a bachelor's in Psychology, but I found true passion in programming after taking a class in my last semester before graduation. I fell in love with it so much that I decided to go back for another bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>There was a sort of satisfaction in seeing things take shape in front of my eyes. With coding, I don't need expensive material or a huge lab. I just need one small machine and I can turn simple lines of code into something amazing for the world.</p><p>I find the most interest in web and mobile app development, but in general, I want to create technology that directly helps people. My goal is to not only develop software but to inspire the same curiosity and passion in others. I want to be inspired and to inspire. So, I combined my two passions - helping children and coding - and co-founded <a href="http://ecbcdev.wordpress.com" target="_blank">DevelopECBC</a> in 2015 to teach kids how to code.</p><p>Outside programming, I am a big foodie. I like trying out new restaurants and cooking new foods. Anything from street food to fine dining.
