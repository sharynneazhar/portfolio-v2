I am a student at the University of Kansas with a degree in Psychology and a pending degree in Computer Science. I started off college with hopes and dreams of becoming a pediatrician, but I was turned away by the dog-eat-dog culture of the industry. So, I thought it would be a better idea to stay in academia and pursue a PhD in child psychology.</p><p>I thought wrong.</p><p>In my last semester before graduating, I enrolled in an elective programming class because I believed it would help me in my research with data analysis. Turns out, I really enjoyed the class.</p><p>Really really enjoyed it.</p><p>It became nonstop. I signed up for courses on websites like Udacity and Codecademy, watched hours and hours of YouTube tutorials, and read forums until dawn. My friends did not understand how I can enjoy such a "boring" task. Even those who are programmers themselves!</p><p>Me neither.</p><p>Though, as I thought about it, everything made sense. Since I was in elementary school, I liked making things. I remembered making RC cars out of my jewelry box when I was 9 years old. I remembered selling modified mechanical pencils to classmates when I was 11 years old. Long story short, there was a sort of a proud satisfaction in seeing things take shape in front of my eyes. With coding, I didn't need material or a huge lab to make something. I only need a small machine and I can turn simple lines of code into something amazing that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>I was so excited to share my enthusiasm for programming with other people. So, I combined my two passions - helping children and coding - and co-founded <a href="http://ecbcdev.wordpress.com" target="_blank">DevelopECBC</a> in 2015 to teach kids how to code. It has been extremely inspiring to witness their creativity and curiosity.</p><p>Outside programming, I am a big foodie. I like trying out new restaurants, eating and cooking new foods, and taking lots and lots of pictures of it. Anything from street food to fine dining.
